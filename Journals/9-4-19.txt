Worked today on Method for generating the implied paths from a certain boardstate.
I developed two new methods, one for generating a "simple path" between two letters, and one for combining two simple paths into a complex path
This method works as expected except in cases where there are two separate  cycles, where it starts to do poorly.
The reason why the method does this is it tries to connect the END of the first cycle to the BEGINNING of the second, which is rarely what actually happened.
I hope to remedy this issue on Friday.
ALSO! Sometimes the combination results in completely invalid paths! I'm working on this now
