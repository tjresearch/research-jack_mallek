OK so I was working on the implied paths method a bit more.
Something that I realized was that the thing would occasionally generate completely invalid paths (e.g. going Up 3 times at the beginning)
I realized this was because the combine method doesn't realize if it can't functionally combine things, so I added functionality to add paths with bad combos only if there are no other options, instead of just returning an empty set
I actually added primitive heuristic capability by adding the length of the path to the number of bad combos times 2.
Something I'm thinking about for next time is adding functionality for the number of times it "goes against its previous movement" and then using that to predict the distance
