Actually, probably a more efficient way of achieving this is to have the algorithm not care about badcombos if it is disconnected.
OK it turns out eliminating badcombos makes my runtime much better, but it increases overestimates, so I have to remove it.
Alright actually I need a more intelligent way of implementing badcombos, because if I do not eliminate them, my runtime becomes unbearably long, but if I do eliminate them I get more overestimates
Alright the numbers are finally in.

Number of overestimates: 2650
Old time: 117 sec
New time: 1811 sec

OK, this is an improvement in terms of number of overestimates but oh my christ this is a travesty when it comes to runtime.
