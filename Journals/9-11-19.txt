OK we made some really good progress today.
So, I deleted my get_visited_and_path method and redid my get_simple_paths method to work with dictionaries of the path as the key and (visited_set, visited_list) as the value
Then, I reworked all my other methods to work with the dictionary rather than the set I was using before
After that I started made my "combine_complex_paths" method that will hopefully allow me to combine the paths implied by two cycles into one implied path for both
What I need to be working on for next time is rewriting my "implied_paths" method to use this new "combine_complex_paths" method
Woo! Today was a good day!
