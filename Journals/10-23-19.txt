"A" -> B means Tile "A" gets mapped to Index B

Proposed method of correcting errored paths with the cycles
Look at all the letters that appear in the cycles of trying to go back from the state with the implied path. These are the tiles that are troublesome
Then, pull up the path list, for example:
['BE', 'CJ']
['0', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'G', 'F', 'J', 'I', 'E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'D']
Then look at these particular numbers and compare them with what is given by the original state.
So for instance. because A comes directly before B, then B comes directly before A, so "B" -> B
Another example, I comes before E, so this implies that "I" -> E.
However, this doesn't happen in the actual state, so therefore these need to be looked at in greater depth.
