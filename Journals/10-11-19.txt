Ok so today I tried tried to fix a specific case where the path intersects itself, and therefore can possibly branch in two different directions.
However, my method does not realize this. It thinks that since the cycles indicate it goes in a certain order, the implied path must go that same way, even if it doesn't.
I started working on a "branch from intersection" method to help remedy this, which I am making progress on, but very much still working on.
